Cut the lemon into two halves and using a lemon squeezer squeeze their juice into a glass(300ml).
Fill the remaining glass with water.
Add a pinch of salt or more according to your taste.(I personally always add one pinch)
Add two tablespoons of sugar or more according to your taste.(I find 1.5 spoon of sugar more than enough)
Stir it all well.
Add ice cubes to the drink in order to make it more refreshing.
